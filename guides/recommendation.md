# Recommendations: Connecting LLMs to External Tools (MCP)

## 1. Industry Standard Approaches

### a. Function Calling / Tool Use APIs
- **OpenAI Function Calling**: Lets you define functions (tools) that the LLM can invoke by returning a structured JSON object. The orchestrator then executes the function and returns results to the LLM or user.
- **Anthropic Tool Use**: Similar to OpenAI, lets you define tools and the LLM will output tool calls in a structured format.
- **Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, etc.**: All major LLM providers are adding this “function/tool calling” capability.

**Key Point:**  
The industry standard is to use a function-calling interface where the LLM emits a structured tool call, which your code executes, and then the result is returned to the user (optionally with LLM summarization).

## 2. Existing Libraries & Frameworks

### a. Python Ecosystem
- **LangChain**: The most popular open-source framework for agentic LLMs with tool/function calling, routing, and orchestration.
- **LlamaIndex**: Similar to LangChain, with focus on data and tool augmentation.
- **OpenAI SDK**: Supports function calling out of the box.

### b. Go Ecosystem
- **Less mature than Python, but options exist:**
  - [go-openai](https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai): Supports OpenAI function calling.
  - [ollama-go](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/tree/main/go): For Ollama, but native function calling is not yet as advanced as OpenAI’s.
  - **Custom orchestration**: Many Go projects implement their own “function calling” bridge, parsing the LLM’s output for tool calls and executing them.

## 3. What If My LLM Doesn’t Support Function Calling?

- **Prompt Engineering**: Prompt the LLM to output tool calls in a specific format (e.g., JSON or a command string), then parse and execute them.
- **Custom Middleware**: Write a layer that detects when a tool call is needed, either by parsing the LLM’s output or by using rules/regex.

## 4. My Recommendation for Your Project

**If you want industry best practices:**
- Use an LLM that supports function/tool calling (OpenAI GPT-4/3.5, Anthropic, etc.).
- Define your MCP tools as “functions” with schemas.
- Use a library/framework (LangChain, go-openai, etc.) to handle orchestration.

**If you want to stick with Go and Ollama:**
- Implement a simple function-calling bridge:
  1. Prompt the LLM to output tool calls in a structured format (e.g., `{"tool": "filesystem", "action": "list", "path": "/Users/tuannvm/Downloads"}`).
  2. Parse the LLM output for tool calls.
  3. Execute the tool call via MCP.
  4. Return the result to the user (optionally letting the LLM summarize it).

**If you want Python and maximum flexibility:**
- Use LangChain or LlamaIndex with OpenAI/Anthropic for function calling and tool orchestration.

## 5. Summary Table

| Approach            | LLM Required    | Library/Framework        | Language | Pros                | Cons                |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| OpenAI Function Call| GPT-3.5/4       | go-openai, LangChain    | Go/Python| Standard, robust    | Needs OpenAI API    |
| Anthropic Tool Use  | Claude          | LangChain, SDK          | Python   | Standard, robust    | Needs Anthropic API |
| Custom Bridge       | Any             | None / custom           | Go       | Flexible, works now | Manual parsing      |
| LangChain           | Any (best w/FC) | LangChain               | Python   | Agentic, batteries  | Python only         |

## 7. What Should You Do?

- If you want to stay in Go and with Ollama, build a simple tool-calling bridge as described above.
- If you want maximum flexibility and industry alignment, consider using OpenAI/Anthropic with function calling and a framework like LangChain.
