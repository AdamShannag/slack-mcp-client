# Requirements for Slack MCP Client

## MCP Server Configuration

- Only MCP servers defined in `mcp-servers.json` should be considered during initialization and tool discovery.
- The client should not attempt to connect to or use hardcoded MCP servers that are not defined in the configuration file.
- This ensures that the application only interacts with explicitly configured MCP servers.

## Tool Discovery

- Tools must be dynamically retrieved from the MCP servers defined in `mcp-servers.json`.
- No hardcoded tool names should be used for initialization or tool discovery.
- The client should query each configured MCP server for its available tools during initialization.
- This ensures that the client remains flexible and can work with any tools provided by the configured servers.
